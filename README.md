# Tokis E-commerce Platform

Tokis is a scalable e-commerce platform designed to handle **50M+ users**, built with **Next.js (App Router)**, **TailwindCSS**, **shadcn/ui**, **Framer Motion**, and **Zustand** for state management.  
The system consists of two sides:
- **Client Side** (User-facing store)  
- **Admin Side** (Management dashboard)  

Both sides follow **DRY principles** with reusable components, a luxury design system (black/gold theme), infinite product carousels, animated sections, and mock checkout (with M-Pesa integration coming later).
